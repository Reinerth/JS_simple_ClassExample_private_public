# JS_simple_ClassExample_private_public
The way I understand a class and would recommend to write a class in JavaScript for best readability and use.

<b>My definition of a Class:</b> Group of objects, functions and variables, usually commonly used (intersection).
<br>
<b>My definition of an Object:</b> Group of properties and their values (like JSON).
<br><br>
Thus, a so-called "CSS-class" is not a class, but an object, because it is a group of properties. 
<br>
CSS-functions like "calc" are only the substitute for the "to-be-generated"-values of their properties.
<br><br>

For a clean modular structure with many classes, <br>
the classes should be integrated in a "namespace".<br>
For having all classes in one container and avoiding "namespace-pollution".<br>
