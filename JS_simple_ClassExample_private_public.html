        Learning JavaScript might be hard, but easier,<br>
        than try to explain the lemmings, they cant stop the flood with love â™¥.

            /**
            * The Class (in all programming languages)
            * 
            * JavaScript has the greatest options for all ways of programming. 
            * Lazy, procedural, with different syntax-rules and frameworks, quick and dirty 
            * or modular, clean and proffesional for high-end-applications.
            * 
            * With ECMA Script 5 (Version 5) it has reached its maximum of needed possibilities, 
            * and best readable syntax (grammar-rules). 
            * "let" vs. "var" is an exception. "let" is an inmprovement. 
            * "let" has a more strict and logic scope than "var".
            * 
            * All other new and different JS-"styles", are bad syntax-ideas. 
            * Arrow-functions, fetch, backticks, promises and so on, 
            * are only to confuse newbies and are bad practice. 
            * They are hard to read and have no advantages 
            * to the classic, native approach of ES5.
            * 
            * A Class does not needs to be created 
            * with a Syntax-given rule from the programming language itself. 
            * Means something like "new Class". The word "class" 
            * has not necessarily to be there, for letting a structure to be a class. 
            * We even could name a class "thisIsNotAClass", 
            * but that doesnt change a thing about the true structure.
            * 
            * The Definition of a Class: 
            * Group of objects, functions and variables, usually commonly used (intersection).
            * 
            * Definition of an Object: 
            * Group of properties and their values (like JSON).
            * 
            * Thus, a so-called "CSS-class" is not a class, but an object, 
            * because it is a group of properties. 
            * CSS-functions like "calc" are only the substitute 
            * for the "to-be-generated"-values of their properties.

             * 
             * For a clean modular structure with many classes, 
             * the classes should be integrated in a "namespace".
             * For having all classes in one container and avoiding "namespace-pollution".
